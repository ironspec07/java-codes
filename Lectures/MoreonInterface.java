/*
 * #1
 * - We can have a class implementing multiple interfaces.
 * class B implemets A,X
 * {
 * }
 * (here, A and X are two different interfaces)
 * - Implementation of all the methods that are present in those interfaces
 * should be given in a class.
 * - Inheritance is also valid in between interfaces.
 * - Inheritance can be achieved in between interfaces by using the extend
 * keyword.
 * - Whenever you create a reference of an interface and create an object of a
 * class, then you can only call those methods by that reference that are
 * present in that interface of which the refernce is created.
 * - Methods of another interface can be called by using another reference
 * variable for that interface with the object of a class.
